# 3D-U-net-Implementation_for-detecting-White-matter-hyperintensities
An implementation of U-NET FCC for the Sematic Segmentation of Brain MR images. This is in reference to Triplanar segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in the brain. This Code is part of my research effort under the supervision and assistance of Dr. Jainy Sachdeva.
